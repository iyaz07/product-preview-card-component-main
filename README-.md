### What I learned

This project helped understand that i can change the Img element corresponding to size in CSS media query asides from the HTMl picture and source tweak that I had previously learnt.
img {
  content: URL("http.....");
}
I also learnt to insert a line break in Css using the before and after Pseudo selector, asides from the HTML <br> syntax i had previously learnt.

#content::after{
    content: "\a";
    white-space: pre;
}


### Continued development
Things I should learn:

    Bootstrap
    SaSS
    Javascript
